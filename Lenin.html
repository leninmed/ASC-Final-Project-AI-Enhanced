                <h1>Lenin Medina</h1>
                <p>Hello everyone, I'm Lenin. I'm a rising senior located in NYC. I'm passionate about STEM, specially about CS and maths. I'm interested in applying 
                CS to solve math problems. This is my second time involved with ASC. The first time I was involved in ASC was when I attended an
                AI discussion meeting. Being in the summer intensive was a great experience, I learned a lot of skills that I could apply
                to get more opportunities and for myself.
