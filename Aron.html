                <h1>Aron</h1>
               <p>Hi, my name is Aron. I’m from Northern California, and I’m a sophomore at River Islands High School. I’m extremely happy that I was able to participate in this year’s All Star Code program and spend the past three weeks learning more about coding. I wanted to join All Star Code because coding was very challenging for me during my freshman year, and it’s something I’ve been eager to improve on. I really appreciate my instructors Neel, Neev, Trew, and Paola being incredibly helpful in guiding me through problems and teaching me how to learn from my mistakes.  As a result of this 3-week exploration sprint, I now feel much more confident in my coding skills.</p>
